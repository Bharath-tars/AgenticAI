AGENTIC AI - Notes by Bharath

# Important points:
Started in Mid 2024 also called AI Agent, Multi AI Agents
More than GenAI
The diff between GenAI and agentic AI is:


GenAi -> create content -> LLM Model
Query ->(prompt) -> LLm -> Output {Generating content}
Also called prompt finetuning

RAG - > Retrieve relevant content that is upto date by giving access to an llm to an external source where data is stored in vectors like ChromeDB(Langchain is used)

Agentic AI -> Autonomous AI Systems / Agents (perform their own tasks)
They have a goal to achieve
All the AI systems work independently to achieve the goal
LangGraph (Agentic AI framework), langflow, Phidata
Solve Complex workflow
Can finetune themselves to perform much more better

Summary
Genai when access to external source makes workflow complex, in agentic AI goal is based on business outcome


Example:

Custom Bot -> Agentic AI -> interacts with many things

Query: Hey i have 1000$ Buy some stocks and sell it in 5 days that can give 50% profit.
Query: Compare tesla and nvdia stock and suggest best one to purchase


Here each workflow is a separate task and each task is handled by an AI separately. These all work together simultaneously  to achieve the goal and then give the output.

Open source framework 
AutoGen(Microsoft) -> https://github.com/microsoft/autogen
LangFlow(No code tool for Agentic AI) -> Dragdrop -> End code will we given -> Later can be deployed - > https://www.langflow.org/
LangGraph(More complex) -> https://www.langchain.com/langgraph
PhiData - > https://www.phidata.com/
CrewAI -> https://www.crewai.com

# The Influence of AI in 2025: Trends you should not miss
Agentic AI
AI Infrastructure -> Gpus as PAAS, Inference compute engine(Fast responses)
Large Models (LLm, LVM) -> Billion to Trillion parameters
AI Edge Devices for Gen AI -> Jetson Nano oron
Small Models(Phi3) -> OpenSource less para for fine tuning
Security AI -> Regulations
Lot of Open Source Models
